    <p>Selling a yacht in Mallorca offers tremendous market advantages. Europe's premier boating destination ensures strong buyer demand, year-round interest, and premium pricing compared to other locations. Follow this step-by-step process to maximize your sale price and speed up the transaction.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Get Professional Valuation</h2>
    <p>Hire a marine surveyor and yacht broker to appraise your vessel. Mallorca's market values depend on: age, condition, maintenance records, engine hours, recent refits, charter history, and location. Comparable analysis of recent sales in your boat category is essential. A realistic asking price attracts serious buyers and speeds sale timelines.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare Complete Documentation</h2>
    <p>Buyers prioritize vessels with thorough documentation. Gather: title and registration, survey reports (recent if available), complete maintenance logs, engine service records, equipment warranties, spare parts inventory, and any insurance history. Organized documentation justifies higher pricing—potentially adding 10-15% to your sale price.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Professional Marketing and Photography</h2>
    <p>Invest in professional photography and video. Quality images dramatically increase buyer interest. Many successful sellers hire drone photographers for aerial footage. Create a professional listing with detailed specifications, features, and positioning. Video tours are increasingly important for attracting international buyers.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Multi-Channel Marketing Strategy</h2>
    <p><strong>YachtWorld:</strong> Primary platform for international buyers. Listing cost: 300-1,000 EUR. Reaches 500K+ qualified boat buyers. <strong>Local Brokers:</strong> Mediterranean specialists with direct buyer access. Commission: 5-10% of sale price. <strong>eBay Motors:</strong> Cost-effective for motorboats and affordable vessels. <strong>Social Media:</strong> Instagram and Facebook ads target younger demographics and charter companies.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Showings and Sea Trials</h2>
    <p>Prepare your yacht for showings: clean, detailed, all systems functional. Coordinate sea trials carefully—they're the final purchasing decision point. Your boat's performance at sea must be flawless. Have a knowledgeable captain or crew member handle trials to showcase the vessel professionally.</p>

    <h2>Factors That Impact Sale Price</h2>
    <p style="margin: 1rem 0;"><strong>Add 15-25%:</strong> Recent professional survey, comprehensive maintenance records, low engine hours, recent refits</p>
    <p style="margin: 1rem 0;"><strong>Subtract 20-40%:</strong> Deferred maintenance, major engine issues, outdated systems, poor condition</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h3>Mediterranean Market Advantage</h3>
      <p>Vessels registered and based in Mallorca command 20-30% premium over identical boats in other locations. Buyers value the Mediterranean registry and active market infrastructure.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Timeline Expectations</h2>
    <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> 2-4 weeks. Valuation, documentation, photography, and listing preparation.</p>
    <p><strong>Active Marketing:</strong> 1-3 months. Average time on market for well-priced, well-marketed vessels.</p>
    <p><strong>Negotiation:</strong> 1-2 weeks. Offers, counteroffers, contingency review.</p>
    <p><strong>Closing:</strong> 2-4 weeks. Legal paperwork, title transfer, final walkthrough.</p>
