    <h1>Storm Season in the Mediterranean: Preparation & Navigation</h1>
    <div style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Published January 2026 | Category: Safety</div>

    <p>Mediterranean storms can develop rapidly with little warning. Understanding seasonal patterns, preparation strategies, and heavy weather tactics could save your life. Here's everything sailors need to know.</p>

    <h2>Mediterranean Storm Seasons</h2>
    <p><strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Most dangerous period. Warm sea temperatures and cooling air create instability. Sudden violent squalls common.</p>
    <p><strong>Spring (April-May):</strong> Secondary danger period. Transition from winter to summer creates unstable weather patterns.</p>
    <p><strong>Winter (November-March):</strong> Strong winds but more predictable systems. Fewer surprise squalls.</p>
    <p><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Generally stable but thermal afternoon winds can be intense.</p>

    <h2>Pre-Season Preparation Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete rigging inspection and replacement of damaged lines</li>
      <li>Test storm sails (trysail, storm jib) under load</li>
      <li>Verify sea anchor (drogue) functionality</li>
      <li>Stock emergency supplies: extra batteries, backup communication</li>
      <li>Review heavy weather tactics with entire crew</li>
      <li>Ensure all hatches and through-hulls are secure and testable</li>
      <li>Install/check life harness attachment points</li>
      <li>Test engine start procedures and backup power</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
      <h3>Warning Signs of Developing Storm</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Barometer dropping rapidly (0.5+ mb/hour = danger)</li>
        <li>Long swell from different direction than current wind</li>
        <li>Unusual cloud formations or dark clouds on horizon</li>
        <li>Temperature sudden drops or increases</li>
        <li>Wind shifts or sudden gusts</li>
        <li>Birds behaving unusually or seeking shelter</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Heavy Weather Tactics</h2>
    <p><strong>Heaving-to:</strong> Secure jib to windward, ease or back mainsail, secure helm to leeward. Boat naturally balances and drifts. Safe, requires minimal crew attention.</p>
    <p><strong>Running off:</strong> Turn downwind in high winds to increase boat speed and reduce apparent wind. Risk: broaching in powerful waves. Use only with experience and suitable boat.</p>
    <p><strong>Sea anchor/drogue:</strong> Deploy sea anchor from bow or stern to slow drift and maintain heading. Reduces wave impact and stress on hull.</p>

    <h2>Navigation During Storms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce canvas aggressively (better under-canvassed than over)</li>
      <li>Maintain log book entries: barometer, wind, sea state, course</li>
      <li>Use navigation tools carefully—electronics may fail</li>
      <li>Monitor VHF for weather updates and emergency broadcasts</li>
      <li>Reduce speed to preserve boat integrity and reduce stress</li>
      <li>Ensure crew rest in rotations; fatigue causes accidents</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Seek Shelter</h2>
    <p>Know harbor locations along your route offering protection in different wind directions. Identify secure anchorages before departing. Don't hesitate to enter harbor early if storm is developing—better safe than sorry.</p>

    <h2>Emergency Procedures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Man overboard:</strong> Execute immediate recovery procedures. Harnesses mandatory</li>
      <li><strong>Hull damage:</strong> Patch from inside, use wooden plugs for holes, activate bilge pumps</li>
      <li><strong>Rig failure:</strong> Secure broken rigging immediately to prevent further damage</li>
      <li><strong>Engine failure:</strong> Deploy sea anchor, maintain VHF communication, call Coast Guard if needed</li>
    </ul>
