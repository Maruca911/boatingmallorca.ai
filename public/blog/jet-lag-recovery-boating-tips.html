    <h1>Jet Lag Recovery While Boating: Tips for International Sailors</h1>
    <div style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Published January 2026 | Category: Travel</div>

    <p>International travelers flying to Mallorca for boat charters often face jet lag—disrupting vacation enjoyment and sailing safety. Here's how to manage it effectively.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Jet Lag</h2>
    <p>Jet lag (desynchronosis) occurs when your body's circadian rhythm doesn't match your destination's time zone. Symptoms: fatigue, difficulty sleeping, reduced alertness. Recovery typically takes 1 day per hour of time difference. Flying east (to Europe) causes worse jet lag than flying west.</p>

    <h2>Pre-Travel Preparation (3-5 days before departure)</h2>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Gradually Shift Your Sleep Schedule</h3>
      <p>If flying east (adding hours), go to bed earlier 3-5 days before departure. Shift by 1-2 hours daily toward destination time zone. Reverse if flying west.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Adjust Light Exposure</h3>
      <p>Bright light is the strongest circadian regulator. Get morning sunlight if shifting sleep earlier. Get evening sunlight if shifting sleep later.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Hydrate and Adjust Diet</h3>
      <p>Increase hydration 2-3 days before travel. Eat light meals on travel day. Avoid heavy foods that complicate sleep.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>During Flight (Transatlantic/Long-Haul)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sleep strategically:</strong> Sleep during times corresponding to nighttime at your destination, not your origin</li>
      <li><strong>Melatonin timing:</strong> Take 0.5-1mg melatonin 30-60 minutes before intended sleep time at destination hours</li>
      <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink 1-2 liters water per 8-hour flight</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid alcohol:</strong> Disrupts sleep quality and dehydrates</li>
      <li><strong>Move around:</strong> Stand, stretch, walk the cabin every 2 hours</li>
      <li><strong>Compression socks:</strong> Reduce DVT risk and blood pooling on long flights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>First Days in Mallorca</h2>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Day 1: Light Activity Only</h3>
      <p>Avoid strenuous sailing. Do light exploration, stretching, short walks. Gauge your alertness and energy levels. Plan easy day at sea or harbor navigation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Day 1-2: Embrace Sunlight</h3>
      <p>Get bright outdoor exposure, especially morning sun. Spend time on deck during prime daylight hours. This accelerates circadian adjustment 40% faster than other methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3>Days 2-3: Progressive Activity</h3>
      <p>Begin more active sailing once sleep improves. 2-3 hour watches are reasonable by day 2-3. Full-intensity sailing by day 3-4 for most people.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Sleep Medications & Supplements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Melatonin:</strong> 0.5-2mg. Natural, safe, non-addictive. Most effective 24-48 hours into recovery</li>
      <li><strong>Valerian root:</strong> Herbal sleep aid. Gentler than prescription options</li>
      <li><strong>Prescription sleep aids:</strong> Consult doctor. Typically short-acting to minimize grogginess during sailing</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Alcohol, heavy sedatives that impair morning alertness or sailing performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sailing-Specific Jet Lag Risks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Impaired judgment and reaction time (critical safety issue)</li>
      <li>Difficulty maintaining alertness during long watches</li>
      <li>Reduced coordination and proprioception (balance, timing)</li>
      <li>Increased likelihood of navigation errors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practice: Skippered Charter for First Days</h2>
    <p>Consider hiring a skipper for Days 1-2. Professional captain handles navigation while you recover. This ensures safety while you adapt to time zone and regain alertness. You can transition to bareboat by Day 3-4.</p>
