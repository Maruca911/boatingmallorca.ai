    <p>Choosing the right charter type is essential for your Mallorca sailing experience. Each option serves different needs, skill levels, and budgets. Here's how they compare:</p>

    <h2>Bareboat Charter</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> You captain your own yacht with no crew provided. You're responsible for navigation, sailing, and all decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Experienced sailors, those who want full control, budget-conscious groups</p>
    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1,500-3,000 EUR/week for 35-45ft sailboat</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> ICC (International Certificate of Competence) or equivalent. Some bareboat companies require RYA Day Skipper or higher.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Maximum freedom, lowest cost, learn local waters intimately, create your own itinerary</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Full responsibility for safety and vessel, requires sailing competence, long hours of active sailing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skippered Charter</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Professional captain handles navigation and sailing. You relax and assist as desired.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those without sailing experience, first-time charters, families who want minimal stress</p>
    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2,500-5,000 EUR/week (includes skipper salary)</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> None—skipper has full certification</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Stress-free charter, learn from an expert, safe and legal compliance guaranteed, local knowledge included</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less autonomy, higher cost, shared itinerary with skipper's preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Crewed Yacht Charter (Luxury)</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Full professional crew including captain, chef, stewardess, engineer. Premium service and gourmet dining.</p>
    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Special occasions, luxury holidays, non-sailors who want complete premium service</p>
    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 10,000-50,000+ EUR/week (depends on yacht size and season)</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Deep pockets and desire for luxury</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Ultimate luxury, personalized service, gourmet meals, professional crew expertise, highest comfort level</li>
      <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Significantly higher cost, less intimacy/privacy, advanced bookings required</li>
    </ul>
