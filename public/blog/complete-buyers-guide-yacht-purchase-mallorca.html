    <h1>Complete Buyer's Guide: How to Purchase a Yacht in Mallorca</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      <strong>Published:</strong> January 2026 | <strong>Category:</strong> Guides | <strong>Author:</strong> Boating Mallorca Team
    </div>

    <p>Mallorca is Europe's premier destination for yacht purchases, with a strong market, professional services, and excellent financing options. This guide walks you through the entire buying process.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Define Your Needs and Budget</h2>
    <p>Before beginning your search, clearly define what you want: vessel type, size, age, condition, intended use, and budget range. Mallorca's market serves buyers from 50,000 EUR for a used RIB to multi-million EUR for a superyacht. Consider whether you'll use it for personal enjoyment, charter income, liveaboard living, or as an investment.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Research the Market</h2>
    <p>Study comparable sales in your target category. Visit major yacht brokers in Palma, attend boat shows, and browse online listings on YachtWorld, eBay Motors, and Mediterranean brokers' websites. You'll develop a realistic understanding of pricing and available inventory.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Arrange Professional Survey</h2>
    <p>This is non-negotiable. Hire an independent marine surveyor to inspect the hull, engine, systems, and structure. Cost: 2,000-4,000 EUR. A detailed survey reveals hidden issues and justifies your offer price.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Financing and Insurance</h2>
    <p>Most banks offer yacht financing at 60-70% LTV (loan-to-value). Interest rates range from 2.5-4.5% depending on vessel age and condition. Get pre-approval before making an offer. Obtain marine insurance quotes—typical cost is 1-3% of boat value annually.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Negotiate and Make an Offer</h2>
    <p>Start your offer 10-15% below asking price. Include survey contingencies, sea trial clauses, and repair allowances. Most sellers expect negotiation—this is normal practice.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Complete Legal Transfer</h2>
    <p>Hire a maritime lawyer to handle title transfer, registration, and Spanish maritime law compliance. This typically costs 2,000-5,000 EUR but is essential for clean ownership and financing.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Ownership Costs</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Expense Category</th>
        <th>Annual Cost (per 100K EUR boat value)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mooring/Marina</td>
        <td>6,000-12,000 EUR</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Insurance</td>
        <td>1,000-3,000 EUR</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Maintenance</td>
        <td>5,000-10,000 EUR</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fuel (if motor)</td>
        <td>2,000-5,000 EUR</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

      <h3>Charter Income Potential</h3>
      <p>Many buyers invest in yachts for charter income. A well-positioned vessel in Mallorca can generate 8-12% annual yield. Some owners use revenue-sharing management companies to handle bookings and logistics.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Key Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mediterranean Registry:</strong> Vessels registered in Spain/Balearics command premium prices and resale value</li>
      <li><strong>Age Factor:</strong> Boats over 40 years old require additional certifications; 10-20 years is the sweet spot for buyers</li>
      <li><strong>Engine Hours:</strong> Critical for motor yachts. Low hours (under 5,000) justify higher prices</li>
      <li><strong>Recent Refits:</strong> New engines, electronics, or structural work add 12-20% to value</li>
      <li><strong>Liveaboard Status:</strong> If you plan to live aboard, ensure the vessel is certified and insured for continuous occupancy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Top Purchase Locations in Mallorca</h2>
    <p><strong>Palma de Mallorca:</strong> Largest selection, luxury marinas, professional services. Best for serious buyers and high-value purchases.</p>
    <p><strong>Port d'Andratx:</strong> Exclusive clientele, premium vessels, boutique marinas. Best for luxury and high-net-worth purchases.</p>
    <p><strong>Port de Pollenca:</strong> Sailing community, good value, family boats. Best for experienced sailors.</p>
    <p><strong>Cala Ratjada:</strong> East coast hub, fishing boats, affordable day-charter vessels. Best for budget-conscious or investment-focused buyers.</p>
